## About

This is a an application for educational purposes only.
It uses webpack to bundle and transpile our ES6 React.js code.
No advanced topics where involved, only the main features to work with Webpack, React.js and Draft.js.
There's no hot reloading, no inline styles, only one loader and there's no complex behaviour on the Draft.js implementation. This is only because of the time we need to explain each feature. We can discuss more in the near future.
